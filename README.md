## Introduction

Welcome to our webpage!
Universal coding is an open-source company that obviously, likes to code.

We do several things, for example:
- Help people if they have any doubt about some programming language
- Help people to fix a bug in their code
- Make repos with tutorials for programming languages or specific purposes
- Etc...

## Our Projects

We are a brand new company, so there is not too much to see here.
We have a Discord Bot called Alexis written in discord.js which you can invite [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=679036215005020388&permissions=8&scope=bot)

We are also thinking of making JS and Lua tutorials

Future projects will be added
